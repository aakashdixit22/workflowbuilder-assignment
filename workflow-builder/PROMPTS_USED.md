# Prompts Used During Development

just keeping track of the main prompts i used while building this. not word-for-word but close enough.

## Project Setup


```

```
set up a flask api that can handle text processing requests. needs endpoints for cleaning text, summarizing, extracting key points, and categorizing
```

```
how do i connect mongodb to a next.js app using mongoose
```

## LLM Integration

```
help me integrate google gemini api into a flask app. need a service class that can handle different types of text processing
```

```
write a prompt for cleaning messy text - fixing typos, removing extra whitespace, normalizing formatting. keep the response clean without explanations
```

how do i categorize text into topics like technology, business, health, etc using an llm
```

## Frontend Development

```
create a react component with a form where users can select 2-4 steps for a workflow and give it a name and description
```

```
show step-by-step results as the workflow runs. display each step's output and show which step is currently processing
```

```
help me style this workflow builder with tailwind. something clean and modern but simple
```

```
add a navigation bar with links to home, history, and status pages using next.js app router
```

```
create a history page that shows the last 10 workflow runs with expandable details
```

```
make a status page showing recent activity and workflow stats
```

## Backend API Routes

```
create next.js api routes for:
- GET all workflows
- POST create new workflow  
- GET workflow by id
- GET run history
```

```
how do i make sequential api calls in react where each step's output becomes the next step's input
```

```
add cors to flask app so next.js frontend can call it
```

## Database Schemas


```
how do i query mongodb to get only the last 10 records sorted by date
```

## Error Handling & Polish

```
add proper error handling to all api routes with try-catch blocks
```

```
show error messages in the ui when workflow execution fails
```

```
add loading states while workflows are running
```

```
validate that users select between 2-4 steps before creating a workflow
```

## Debugging

```
why is my workflow not saving to mongodb - getting connection error
```

```
flask api returns 500 when calling gemini, how to debug this
```

```
results not displaying correctly after workflow runs, state not updating
```



## Improvements & Features

```
how can i make the workflow cards look better with tailwind
```

```
add icons or visual indicators for different step types
```

```
format the timestamp display to be more readable
```

most of these are paraphrased but capture the general idea of what i was asking. probably forgot some but these are the main ones.
